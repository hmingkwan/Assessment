            "\n",
            "Based on the provided client information, John Chan's financial situation is characterized by a significant income, but a relatively low savings rate. His investments are diversified, with a focus on stocks and bonds, and he has a substantial mortgage and car loan. John's short-term financial goals are ambitious, with an emergency fund goal of HKD $700,000 in 1 year. His medium-term goal is to save HKD $1,000,000 for a down payment on a house in 5 years. Finally, his long-term goal is to retire at age 60 with a monthly income of HKD $10,000.\n",

            "**Recommendations**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Increase Savings Rate**: Given John's relatively low savings rate, it is recommended that he increase his monthly savings rate to at least 20% of his income, aiming for 25% by the end of the 5-year period.\n",
            "2. **Diversify Investments**: John's investments are diversified, but it is recommended that he consider increasing his allocation to bonds, as the interest rate is relatively low. Additionally, he should consider consulting with a financial advisor to determine the optimal asset allocation for his specific risk tolerance and investment horizon.\n",
            "3. **Pay Off Debt**: John should focus on paying off his mortgage and car loan as quickly as possible. It is recommended that he prioritize paying off the mortgage first, as it has a higher interest rate.\n",
            "4. **Build Emergency Fund**: John should aim to build an emergency fund of at least 3-6 months of expenses, which would be HKD $210,000 to HKD $420,000. This will provide him with peace of mind and financial security in case of unexpected expenses.\n",
            "5. **Retirement Savings**: John should consider contributing to a retirement savings plan, such as a Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) or a Self-Managed Unit Trust (SMUT), to take advantage of any employer matching contributions.\n",

            "3. **Retirement Fund Building**: Since the client's age is 28, it is recommended to start building a retirement fund earlier. It is suggested to increase the monthly savings to HKD $30,000 and HKD $50,000 to cover the higher interest rate.\n",
